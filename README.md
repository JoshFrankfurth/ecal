## Preface

The **e**nhanced **C**ommunication **A**bstraction **L**ayer (eCAL) is a middleware that enables scalable, high performance interprocess communication on a single computer node or between different nodes in a computer network.
eCAL uses a **publish / subscribe** pattern to automatically connect different nodes in the network. It's choosing the best available data transport mechanisms - **UDP** for network communication and **High Performance Shared Memory** for local communication.

eCAL

* is fast (up to 6GB/s for a local interprocess connection)
* provides publish / subribe and client / server patterns
* is designed brokerless
* provides a C++ and C interface for easy integration into other languages (like python or csharp)
* runs on windows, linux, intel and arm platforms
* has powerful tools for recording, replay and monitoring all your data flows - decentralized
* integrates gently into your ROS2 environement with the brand new [eCAL RMW](https://github.com/continental/rmw_ecal)  

Really ?? Just another pub/sub middleware ? Why ? What is the different to my beloved fully featured DDS ?

* it's stupid simple - no complex configuration effort for all kind of communication details or QOS settings
* it's message protocol agnostic - choose the message protocol that fits to your needs like [Google Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), [CapnProto](https://capnproto.org/), [Flatbuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) ..
* it's using the standardized recording format [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/)

What is on the roadmap ?

* macos, qnx platform support
* more language bindings (rust, go-lang)
* and ?? tell us about your use case :-)
